# graphs_tradke

A Python package implementing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Breadth-First Search (BFS), another type of search we learned in CS2050. This package provides efficient algorithms for working with graphs, making it useful for a variety of applications in computer science, including shortest path calculations and graph traversals.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverses the graph level by level, useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

## Installation

To install the package, clone the repository and use `pip3`:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/t-radke/CS3250-hw4

# Navigate to the src directory
cd CS3250-hw4/src

# Install the package
pip install .
